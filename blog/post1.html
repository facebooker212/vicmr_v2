        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is meant to be the directory for future posts, I plan on sharing personal projects and ideas worth keeping here on the internet in the hopes of someone finding them useful or interesting. For now this might have few posts but this is also to force myself and keep this personal webpage finally organized, it has been very simple and ugly for too long (since 2021). To start I plan on sharing my current home lab setup and my desktop environments I have set up in both gentoo and arch systems that I use daily. If you are interested in those topics you might find something useful :).</p>
